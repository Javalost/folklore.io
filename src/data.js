    "name" : "Gore Orphanage",
    "story": "A local legend in Northern Ohio, which refers to a supposedly haunted ruin near the city of Vermilion in Lorain County, Ohio.\n\nThe ruin is a building that formerly housed the Swift Mansion and, later, the Light of Hope Orphanage, and is the subject of local urban legends, whereby the violent deaths of young adults and children are alleged to have occurred. According to the urban legends, supernatural activity has occurred in the building since its closure.\n\nThe legend of the Gore Orphanage is thought to have originated in the early 1900s. The Swift Mansion was built in 1856 by John Swift, a wealthy industrialist. Swift died in 1890, and the mansion was inherited by his daughter, Mary Swift. Mary Swift opened the Light of Hope Orphanage in the mansion in 1901.\n\nThe Light of Hope Orphanage was a boarding school for orphaned and abandoned children. The children at the orphanage were reportedly subjected to physical and emotional abuse. In 1910, a fire broke out at the orphanage and killed several children. The fire was reportedly caused by arson, and the culprit was never caught.\n\nThe orphanage closed in 1911, and the building has been abandoned ever since. The building has been the subject of numerous reports of paranormal activity, including ghostly apparitions, disembodied voices, and unexplained noises.\n\nSome people believe that the ghosts of the children who died in the fire still haunt the building. Others believe that the ghosts are the spirits of the orphans who were abused at the orphanage.\n\nWhether or not the Gore Orphanage is actually haunted is a matter of debate. However, the legend of the Gore Orphanage continues to be a popular one in Northern Ohio.",
